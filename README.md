## Intro

Similar to [ui-router][4] for Angular, React Resolver lets you define & load
data dependencies as close to the templates using them as possible: the _Components_.

You may be asking, **how is this different from [Relay & GraphQL][7]**?

Both projects are working to solve the similar problems:

> Data fetching is still a tricky problem, especially as applications become more complicated.

With [Relay & GraphQL][7]:

> Each component specifies its own data dependencies declaratively **using a query language called GraphQL**. The data is made available to the component via properties on `this.props`.

_(Emphasis my own)_

With React Router, whether you use [Flux-like
_Stores_][9], hand-crafted _Services_, or even isomorphic HTTP libraries like
[superagent][8], is **up to you**.

**Once Relay is released, you should be to make a smooth transition (if you'd like!),
as your templates should still be expecting the same data via `this.props`**.


## Installation

```shell
$ npm install --save react-resolver
```

```javascript
var Resolver = require('react-resolver');

// Create an instance
var resolver = new Resolver();

// or, if you prefer factories...
var resolver = Resolver.create();
```


## Usage

### 1. Specify Props to Lazy-Load

```javascript
var Resolver = require('react-resolver');

var UserView = React.createClass({
  mixins: [Resolver.mixin],

  statics: {
    resolve: {
      // Return a Promise
      user: function() {
        return UserStore.find(this.getParams().userId);
      },

      // or use a Callback
      user: function(done) {
        request.get(`/users/${this.getParams().userId}`, done);
      }
    }
  },
  ...
});
```


### 2.  Wrap your `<Route />`

Assuming you're using [React Router][3], you'll need to wrap your routes
to maintain `context`:

```javascript
var resolver  = require('resolver').create();
var routes    = resolver.route(require('./routes'));
```

This makes it possible for your `statics.resolve` props to access
`Router.State`, `Router.Navigation`, and other contexts.


### 3. Resolve & Render

#### Client

Because the client supports lazy-loading of components, you can use
`React.render` as usual.

The only caveat is, if you're using [react-router][3], you'll need to
wrap your routes with `resolver.route` to maintain context:

```javascript
var Resolver  = require('resolver');
var routes    = require('./routes');

var resolver = Resolver.create();

Router.run(resolver.route(routes), function(Handler) {
  React.render(<Handler />, document.getElementById('app'));
});
```

On the server, _all promises have to be resolved **before** rendering_
and sending the response via `resolver.resolve`.

Be sure to create a new instance of the `Resolver` per-request to avoid
leaking props to different users!

```javascript
var Resolver  = require('resolver')
var routes    = require('./routes');

// Your middleware here...
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  var resolver = Resolver.create();

  Router.run(resolver.route(routes), function(Handler) {
    resolver.handle(Handler).then(function(resolved) {
      res.send(React.renderToStaticMarkup(resolved));
    });
  });
});
```
